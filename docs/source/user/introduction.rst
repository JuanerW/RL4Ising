Description
===========
Welcome to `Reinforcement Learning for Ising Problem <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_! 

`RL4Ising <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_ showcases multiple approaches to evaluate and find solutions to Ising problems.

The included notebooks provide code for executing and evaluating neural-network-equipped algorithms for finding solution to the Ising problem.

Featured models include:
- Fully Connected
- Recurrent Neural Network (Spin Level)
- Recurrent Neural Network (Solution Level)
- Transformer

In addition, our notebooks provide two distinct methods of finding solutions: policy gradient and actor-critic.

Most notably, our code features a curriculum-learning paradigm to elevate the performance of our models. 


Motivation
==========
The Ising Problem is a prominent physics problem spanning over 100 years. Our goal is to leverage emerging innovations in machine learning to provide a new approach for solving these problems.

Our goal is to systematically show the advantages of varying models and implementations when finding solutions to show the strength of reinforcement learning in this environment.

Chiefly, we want to demonstrate that reinforcement learning approaches can outperform current state-of-the-art solvers and unlock new solutions to unsolved problems.
