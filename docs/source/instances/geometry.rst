Graph Geometry
==============

In this subpage we will explore the different graph geometries that may be present as Ising models.

Toroidal
===========

A toroidal Ising model contains a lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The criterion for the boundary conditions are as follows:

1) The left edge is adjcaent to the right edge.

2) The top edge is adjacent to the bottom edge.

These conditions create a surface that has no boundaries. In other words, it ensures every spin has the same number of neighors. The image below depicts a 4-dimensional toroidal graph.
