Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
======================================

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards and penalties.
Through repetitive trials, the agent learns to perform actions that maximize a long-term reward. This type of feedback system can be applied to the Ising model where rewards can be given
as the agent arranges the spins more closely to a ground state configuration.

The Role of RL in finding Ising Model Solutions
===============================================

We will now highlight some of the benefits of RL, and how they apply to the Ising model.

1) **Efficient Exploration of Solution space:** One of the largest constraints when solving the Ising model is the vast number of configurations. Traditional methods may use techniques
   such as random sampling to find potential solutions to the problem. This becomes extremely inefficient for large systems and encourages the use of alternative solvers that employ
   stochastic methods of finding solutions. RL, however, can guide the exploration of the spin configurations more effectively. By training an agent to explore the solution space, it
   can learn the most promising regions of the graph to focus on, thus speeding up convergence to high-quality solutions.
2) **Improving Quality of Solutions:** By using RL to optimize the configurations of spins, the agent can minimize the energy of a system more efficiently than traditional methods. This
   translates to solutions being found that are closer to the optimal solution. This improvement is beneficial in large systems or systems with complex interactions.
3) **Real-time Adaptation:** Another advantage of RL is its ability to adapt in real-time. In the context of the Ising model, this mean that the RL agent can adjust its strategy as it explores the environment.

The integration of RL as a solver for the Ising model holds great promise for improving efficiency and accuracy. In particular, by leveraging RL's capabilities for dynamic adaptation,
efficient exploration, and quality optimization, an RL-enabled solver can outperform traditional methods.
