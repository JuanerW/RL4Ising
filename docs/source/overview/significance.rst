Significance of Ising Model
===========================

The Ising model, a mathematical model in statistical mechanics, has been a cornerstone in modeling a variety of physics-based systems. The model involves a lattice of spins, each of which
are in one of two states, with interactions dependent on neighboring spins. Finding solutions to the Ising model is critical in effectively simulating and understanding physical
phenomena. Further, the Ising model problem can be abstracted to various other fields, such as computer science, social science, and biology. Developing an efficient solver to this problem 
would enable advancements in fields broader than solely physics.

Traditionally, the Ising model has been approached with techniques like Monte Carlo simulation. While this method provides high-quality results, it can be computationally expensive,
especially in high-dimensional systems. Moreover, obtaining high-quality solutions in complex systems is difficult due to the nonconvex, large solution space. Recently, reinforcement 
learning paradigms have been able to efficiently learn NP-hard problems such as the Ising model, and can find high-quality solutions.
