Welcome to `Reinforcement Learning for Ising Problem <https://github.com/YangletLiu/RL4Ising>`_! 

This project showcases a variety of approaches designed to find solutions to the Ising model problem. While our methodology focuses on the integration of reinforcement learning (RL), we provide
a range of alternative methods that can be used for comparison and evaluation. The goal is to explore innovative RL techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Ising model solutions
while providing a comprehensive dataset to compare and reproduce results.

This repository includes a series of notebooks with code to execute and evaluate a transformer-based algorithm for solving the Ising model. A notable feature of our implementation is the
use of **curriculum learning**, which is designed to progressively enhance the performance of our model, leading to more efficient and accurate solutions. 

Motivation
==========

The Ising model has been a fundamental problem in statistical physics for over a century, providing insight into phase transitions, magnetism, and critical phenomena. Our objective is to
leverage the advances in RL to offer a more effective approach to finding solutions of the Ising model.

Through this project, we systematically demonstrate the advantages of different model architectures and learning paradigms when applied to the Ising model. By doing so, we strive to
showcase the strength of RL applied to this problem.

Chiefly, our goal is to illustrate that RL approaches can surpass traditional methods in both performance and scalability. Moreover, we believe RL-based methods have the potential to
advance what has been a long-standing challenge in physics and related fields.
