=============================
Task 2: RL4Ising
=============================

RL4Ising is a task that challenges you to build agents designed to search for the ground state of Ising models and surpass industry-level MIP solvers. 
Your mission: trains agents to effectively navigate the huge discrete space of the Ising model to search for the ground state, while overcoming complexities from scale and dimensionality. 
This task builds upon RL4Maxcut --- an integration of Physics and RL designed for real-world scientific applications.

Task Overview
======================

In this task, participants are invited to develop ground state agents capable of obtaining high quality solutions and feature improved scalbility or performance than industry-level solvers. 
Participants can explore a variety of avenues, including but not limited to:

- Improve Boltzmann Distribution sampling
- Explore alternative RL algorithms, such as, 

Participants are encouraged to propose creative improvements and extensions that further advance the search for the ground state.

Why this Matters
===================

Modern RL models fall victim to the huge solution space and optimization plateau. They tend to have trouble efficiently exploring the discrete space and improving the quality of their solutions.

RL4Ising introduces a curriculum learning solution with:

- Masked Transformers: Learn an attend to increasing sized portions of the Ising model.
