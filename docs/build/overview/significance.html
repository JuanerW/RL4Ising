<h1>Significance<a class="headerlink" href="#significance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The Ising model, a mathematical model in statistical mechanics, has been a cornerstone in modeling a variety of physics-based systems. The model involves a lattice of spins, each of which
are in one of two states, with interactions dependent on neighboring spins. Finding solutions to the Ising model is critical in effectively simulating and understanding physical
phenomena. Further, the Ising model problem can be abstracted to various other fields, such as computer science, social science, and biology. Developing an efficient solver to this problem
would enable advancements in fields broader than solely physics.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Ising model has been approached with techniques like Monte Carlo simulation. While this method provides high-quality results, it can be computationally expensive,
especially in high-dimensional systems. Moreover, obtaining high-quality solutions in complex systems is difficult due to the nonconvex, large solution space. Recently, reinforcement
learning paradigms have been able to efficiently learn NP-hard problems such as the Ising model, and can find high-quality solutions.</p>

<h2>Reinforcement Learning Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#reinforcement-learning-overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards and penalties.
Through repetitive trials, the agent learns to perform actions that maximize a long-term reward. This type of feedback system can be applied to the Ising model where rewards can be given
as the agent arranges the spins more closely to a ground state configuration.</p>

<h2>The Role of RL in finding Ising Model Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#the-role-of-rl-in-finding-ising-model-solutions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We will now highlight some of the benefits of RL, and how they apply to the Ising model.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Efficient Exploration of Solution space:</strong> One of the largest constraints when solving the Ising model is the vast number of configurations. Traditional methods may use techniques
such as random sampling to find potential solutions to the problem. This becomes extremely inefficient for large systems and encourages the use of alternative solvers that employ
stochastic methods of finding solutions. RL, however, can guide the exploration of the spin configurations more effectively. By training an agent to explore the solution space, it
can learn the most promising regions of the graph to focus on, thus speeding up convergence to high-quality solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improving Quality of Solutions:</strong> By using RL to optimize the configurations of spins, the agent can minimize the energy of a system more efficiently than traditional methods. This
translates to solutions being found that are closer to the optimal solution. This improvement is beneficial in large systems or systems with complex interactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real-time Adaptation:</strong> Another advantage of RL is its ability to adapt in real-time. In the context of the Ising model, this mean that the RL agent can adjust its strategy as it explores the environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The integration of RL as a solver for the Ising model holds great promise for improving efficiency and accuracy. In particular, by leveraging RL’s capabilities for dynamic adaptation,
efficient exploration, and quality optimization, an RL-enabled solver can outperform traditional methods.</p>
