The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for solving the Ising model. This dataset will serve as a resource for researchers and developers aiming
to compare and evaluate a range of solvers and methodologies on the Ising model. By providing a consistent, reproducible framework, the project seeks to facilitate comparisons for the
development of new techniques.

1) **Constructing a Robust Dataset:** The dataset will consist of a variety of Ising model configurations across different system sizes, lattice types, and Ising model types. These diverse
   datasets will enable the testing of solvers spanning real-world scenarios. This ensures that each method can be evaluated on instances that range from easy to hard to fully capture
   the solver's ability. By including various boundary conditions, spin interactions, and lattice structures, the dataset will ensure that all important aspects of the Ising model are
   represented.
2) **Benchmarking Solvers:** A key objective is to establish benchmarks for comparing the performance of different solvers for the Ising model. These benchmarks will provide information
   on both the efficiency and quality of the solver. We will compare the strengths and weaknesses of each solver across different conditions and help researchers identify the best methods. 
3) **Reproducibility:** To encourage the continued evolution of solvers for this problem, all data and experiments will be made publicly available, allowing other researchers to reproduce
   the findings. This reproducibility is crucial for validating new methods and ensuring advances made are based on verifiable results. By providing detailed codebases, this project aims
   to contribute to the broader scientific community and accelerate the pace of research in statistical mechanics, machine learning, and optimization.
