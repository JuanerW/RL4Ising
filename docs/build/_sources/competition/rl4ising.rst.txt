Task 2: RL4Ising
=========================================

RL4Ising is a task that challenges you to develop a ground state agent capable of surpassing commerical MIP solvers. 
Your mission: trains agents to search for the ground state of Ising models via an abstraction using the Maxcut problem, while overcoming complexities from scale and dimensionality. 
This task builds upon RL4Maxcut --- an integration of Physics and RL designed for real-world scientific applications.

Task Overview
======================

In this task, participants are invited to build ground state agents featuring improved scalbility and performance than industry-level solvers. 
Expanding upon RL4Maxcut, participants can explore a variety of avenues, including but not limited to:

- Improve sampling
- Use alternative RL aglrothims, such as, 

Participants are encouraged to propose creative improvements and extensions that further advance the search for the ground state.
